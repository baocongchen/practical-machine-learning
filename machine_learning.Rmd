# Load Data and necessary package to build models

We'll load the data and visualize the distribution of our dependant variable

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE}
train <- read.csv('pml-training.csv')
test <- read.csv('pml-testing.csv')
library(caret)
library(gbm)
library(caTools)
library(outliers)
ggplot(train, aes(x=classe)) + geom_bar(position='identity')
dim(train); dim(test)
```


# Preprocess the data

1. Remove variables that have zero or near zero variance because they're not so useful for predicting the outcome. 

```{r}
colDelIndex <- nearZeroVar(train)
train <- train[,-colDelIndex]
trainIndices <- train$X
```

2. Remove irrelevant columns (features) that do not contribute to the accuracy of the predictive models

```{r}
#Remove the timestamps
train <- dplyr::select(train, -c(X:cvtd_timestamp))
#Remove columns whose percentage of NA values is more than 5% of the total cells its column         
colIndices <- colMeans(is.na(train)) <= 0.05
train <- train[,colIndices]
```

3. Replace the outliers of each column in the data with its median

```{r}
for (i in 1:55) {
  if (class(train[1,i]) %in% c('numeric','integer')) {
    for (n in 1:20) {
      train[,i] <- rm.outlier(train[,i], fill = TRUE) 
    }
  }
}
```

# Build 3 models and perform cross validation

Randomly select from the training data 3 sub-samples for cross validation. 
We'll use *randorm forest*, *generalized boosted model*, and *linear discriminant analysis* methods.

```{r results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
meanrf <- 0
meangbm <- 0
meanlda <- 0 
fold_length <- 3
for (i in 1:fold_length) {
  set.seed(3000+i)
  sampleIndices <- sample(trainIndices, 1000)
  dataNSample <- train[sampleIndices,]
  rowIndices <- sample.split(dataNSample$classe,SplitRatio = .7)
  trainNSample <- dataNSample[rowIndices,]
  rf  <- train(classe~., data = trainNSample, method='rf')
  gbm <- train(classe~., data = trainNSample, method='gbm')
  lda <- train(classe~., data = trainNSample, method='lda')
  rfpred  <- predict(rf, trainNSample)
  gbmpred <- predict(gbm, trainNSample)
  ldapred <- predict(lda, trainNSample)
  #Test the performance of each models
  testNSample <- dataNSample[-rowIndices,]
  rfTestpred <- predict(rf, testNSample)
  gbmTestpred <- predict(gbm, testNSample)
  ldaTestpred <- predict(lda, testNSample)
  #Calculate the accuracy of each model by adding them incrementally
  meanrf <-  meanrf + confusionMatrix(rfTestpred, testNSample$classe)$overall['Accuracy'][[1]]
  meangbm <- meangbm + confusionMatrix(gbmTestpred, testNSample$classe)$overall['Accuracy'][[1]]
  meanlda <- meanlda + confusionMatrix(ldaTestpred, testNSample$classe)$overall['Accuracy'][[1]]
}
```

# Evaluate the result
Print the average accuracy of each model after performing cross validation. 

```{r}
print(c(meanrf=meanrf/fold_length, meangbm=meangbm/fold_length, meanlda=meanlda/fold_length))
```

The result shows that `rf` has done the best job in predicting the outcome.
Now let's use our best model to predict the `classe` of `test` data.

```{r}
rfFinalTestpred <- predict(rf, test)
rfFinalTestpred
```
